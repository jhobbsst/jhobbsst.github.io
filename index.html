            <h3>Playing Music</h3><br>
            I have loved playing violin since I was 17. It is not the first instrument I picked up. My first memory is tapping away on a snare drum, then a toy guitar, or maybe the keyboard came first? At 25 years old, I have started to learn the guitar. I would like to be able to play with other musicians.
            
            <h3>Learning Languages</h3><br>
             The reason I love learning languages is because when I meet someone who does not speak my language and I can at least say the basic courteous things to them in their language, their face lights up. They are some of my best memories.
            
            <h3>Being Outdoors</h3><br>
            I love having shelter, but when I step foot outdoors, it is like I am coming home. I breathe in the fresh air and walk for about an hour per day. It really helps my physical and mental health.
